# SOLID
Solid examples

This project aims to review the rules of SOLID.

This solution has five projects, one for each rule, and each project is divided in two main classes, one with an example that break the rule (NameOfRule+Broken)
and another that fix the problems by apllying the rule (NameOfRule+OK), for example SingleResponsabilityBroken and SingleResponsabilityOk

To execute the project: 
1. Open the .sln with Visual Studio and click on the solution in the solution explorer.
2. Select the startup project that you want to test
3. Uncomment the main method of the example you want to test
4. Run it
